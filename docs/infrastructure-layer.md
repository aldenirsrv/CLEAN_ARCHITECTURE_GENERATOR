## 🗂️ Infrastructure Layer: External Concerns & Technical Details

The infrastructure layer handles all external concerns and technical implementation details. It contains **concrete implementations** of interfaces defined in the application layer, including databases, APIs, frameworks, and third-party services. This layer depends on both domain and application layers.

### Key Principles

The infrastructure layer implements the technical details that make your application work in the real world.

**It is:**
- **Concrete** – Contains actual implementations of abstractions defined in application layer
- **Replaceable** – Can be swapped without affecting business logic (Dependency Inversion)
- **Framework-dependent** – Where framework-specific code lives
- **Externally-focused** – Handles databases, APIs, file systems, and external services

### Directory Structure
```
src/
 ├── infrastructure/         
 │   ├── repositories/       # Data persistence implementations
 │   ├── external/           # Third-party services, APIs, messaging
 │   └── config/             # Framework setup, dependency injection
```

### Component Responsibilities
- **Repositories** – Concrete implementations of repository interfaces (ORM, SQL, NoSQL)
- **External** – Third-party integrations (payment gateways, email services, cloud storage, message queues)
- **Config** – Framework configuration, dependency injection containers, environment setup

## Rules
- ✅ Implements application interfaces
- ✅ Framework-specific code lives here
- ✅ Database and API interactions
- ❌ No business logic

### SOLID in Practice
- **Single Responsibility** – Each implementation handles one technical concern
- **Open/Closed** – New implementations added without modifying existing ones
- **Liskov Substitution** – All implementations respect interface contracts
- **Interface Segregation** – Implements focused interfaces from application layer
- **Dependency Inversion** – Depends on application interfaces, not the other way around

### Design Guidelines
- **Implement Application Interfaces** – Never create infrastructure that isn't needed by application layer
- **Isolate Framework Code** – Keep framework-specific code contained and separated
- **Use Adapters** – Wrap third-party libraries to protect inner layers from changes
- **Configuration Management** – Centralize environment variables and feature flags
- **Error Translation** – Convert technical exceptions to domain-meaningful errors

### Common Patterns
- **Repository Pattern** – Abstract data access behind domain-friendly interfaces
- **Adapter Pattern** – Translate between external APIs and internal models
- **Factory Pattern** – Create complex infrastructure objects
- **Dependency Injection** – Wire up implementations to interfaces
